<p>Granville Homes broke ground on its 10th Home of Hope at a ceremony on Wednesday, March 4, 2015 in the new Belterra Community located near Fowler and Shields.

<p>This year’s 2,016-square-foot home will feature the Encore floor plan with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a two-car garage. It comes fully landscaped, with a prepaid solar lease and Granville Eco-Smart technology. Designer features include custom window coverings, upgraded tile flooring, granite kitchen counters, marble in the bathrooms and the Granville Pulse tech package.</p>

<p>Fresno Lexus is a new partner in the event this year, and will be donating a two-year lease on a 2015 Lexus NX SUV to be raffled off as a prize. Anyone who purchases a special 2 ticket bundle will be entered into a special drawing to win the lease.  The drawing for the 2015 Lexus will take place on June 11, 2015 during the KSEE 24 telethon.</p>

<p>Proceeds will benefit Community Food Bank, Poverello House, Hinds Hospice, Assistance League, Renaissance Scholars at Fresno State, and the Foundations for Clovis, Sanger, and Central Schools, and for the first time, EPU Children’s Center and Fresno Police Chaplaincy.</p>

<p>The Foundation for Central School is selling tickets to the Home of Hope through its board members and at the District office.  100% of all tickets sold through the Foundation will stay with the Foundation and will fund Central Coats for Kids, Holiday Joy and Classroom Grants.</p>

<p>The 2015 Granville Home of Hope Grand Prize Drawing will take place on June 18. Visit www.gvhomeofhope.com for more information.</p>
